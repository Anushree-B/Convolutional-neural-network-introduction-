## 1. Introduction to CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized deep learning models designed to process and analyze structured data like images. They are primarily used in **computer vision tasks** such as:  
- Image classification  
- Object detection  
- Facial recognition  

### How CNN Works
- Breaks down an image into smaller patterns like eyes, ears, and nose.  
- Combines these features to identify the object.  
For example, to identify a cat, CNN detects features like **ears**, **eyes**, and **fur patterns**, and concludes, "It's a CAT."

## 2. Why Use CNN?
Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs) face challenges like:  
- Loss of spatial information  
- Parameter explosion  
- Computational inefficiency  

CNNs overcome these issues by:  
- Sharing parameters across layers  
- Preserving spatial hierarchies  
- Being translation-invariant

## 3. Layers of CNN

### 3.1 Convolutional Layer
- Uses filters (kernels) to extract feature maps from the input image.  
- Captures patterns like edges and textures.  

### 3.2 Pooling Layer
- Reduces the dimensions of feature maps to minimize overfitting and computation.  
- Types:  
  - **Max Pooling**  
  - **Average Pooling**  
  - **Sum Pooling**  

### 3.3 Flattening
- Converts multi-dimensional feature maps into a 1D array.  
- Prepares data for fully connected layers.

### 3.4 Fully Connected Layer
- Integrates all learned features and identifies patterns/relationships.  

### 3.5 Output Layer
- Final decision-making layer that outputs the classification results.  
- Example: "This image is most likely a cat with 80% confidence."
